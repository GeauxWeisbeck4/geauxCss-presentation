## URGENT - Help me get my laptop out of pawn shop

I know what you are thinking and what people will say - why would you pawn your laptop? Save your breath though because I have already beat myself down on this one. To understand the reason why I pawned it, I have to explain the situation that I was in.

## Unhoused and Looking for Work

My fiance and I have been unhoused now for almost two years. I don't want to get too much into it because I don't want it to be how I am seen as an entrepreneur or a person and I don't expect nor want you to feel sorry for me. Empathy, kindness, and respect are all acceptable, but I don't want sympathy for my situation. It is what it is and it has been extremely challenging, but I really think being homeless has made me a better person and has motivated me to work my ass off lately.

I also want to be clear that I am not sitting here trying to beg for money. I already had to do that to survive for a few months and it really sucked. A few important choices allowed me to focus on other things and I now spend my time working on projects, building my business, applying for jobs, seeking new clients, and learning everyday to become the best developer I can be.

I also did have a job from May through August of this year at Walmart. The pay wasn't going to get us into housing and I didn't get treated very well because of my living situation. It's also worth mentioning that my job had me loading stuff into people's cars all day in extremely hot and humid working conditions. After working 8 hours during the hottest part of the day (1:30 pm - 10), I would have to attempt to sleep in our tent and it really didn't cool off at all during the night, so I usually laid awake sweating all night until the sun would come up.

While I was initially enthusiastic about having a job and purpose again after a long period of unemployment, I quickly became depressed, physically exhausted, and mentally drained from dealing with how I was treated by Walmart. All the money I made went to feeding two people and paying for a hotel room a couple nights a week to get out of the extreme heat for a bit. My fiance could tell that working at Walmart was taking a big toll on me and talked to me about quitting and focusing my developer career.

## Learning, Applying to Jobs, and Tar Heel Dev Studio

Now I have been learning programming in one form or another since graduating college in 2014. But I really started learning full-stack development in 2020 and got my first tech oriented role at a cybersecurity company in 2021. After I lost that job in 2021, I really got serious about learning and switching careers to become a full-stack developer.

2022 was difficult and I had maybe close to 30 interviews for developer jobs and it really shook my confidence. I finally had an interview in November 2022 and I impressed a company enough to want to hire me - there was a problem though. I lived in Raleigh, NC with no car and the job was all the way out in a forest somewhere near Durham, NC. I couldn't take the job and it has taken me a while to get back into interviewing for jobs due to being homeless.

Now I technically started Tar Heel Dev Studio in 2021, but I never really marketed it much even though I had a website and everything. I did most of my freelance work as just good ol' me and not as the Tar Heel Dev Studio brand. I've always had the brand in the back of my mind and never gave up on the brand. That brings us to the last few months.

About a month ago, I had been in a cycle of just non-stop studying for coding interviews and applying for jobs. I wasn't building any projects that would make me money, mainly just projects that helped me grow my skills as a developer. I credit the lack of bills, low cost of living, and the amount of free time I've had to really taking a huge leap forward as a developer. I feel on top of my game right now and it honestly has been awesome to get to learn all day every day.

But as somebody who studied for a master's in economics that that I never have been able to complete, I understand that there is an opportunity cost for every decision that I make. The opportunity cost for learning so much was missing out on money that could have been made. My fiance has had to continue to panhandle while we both continue to look for work and neither of us like that she still has to do that. I am still applying for jobs and waiting on that process takes time, so I decided that something had to be done.

That is where Tar Heel Dev Studio came back into the picture for me. I decided the best way to help our situation while searching for work would be to get my web development business going again, so I started builidng the new website a few weeks ago - [you can find it here](https://tarheeldevstudio.com). There's a lot of work to do still, but it is up and serving as my main focus for current marketing efforts.

This whole fundraising campaign came about after I recently decided to help out a non-profit client who didn't have a big budget for hiring a web developer. I really believe in his organization and want to help them out by building an awesome web app. The only problem is I can't afford the costs of my business without making money obviously. But if I raise money to help pay for things like software I need for my business, for servers to host projects and store data, and to help me afford expenses to stay alive, then I can really help non-profits and other small businesses out in a big way.

One thing I have really noticed while trying to start this business is that there are a lot of business owners who either don't want to pay very much for my work or simply can't afford it. The first category are customers that I don't really deal with because I don't believe in underselling myself - lowering the cost of my services for people who want to be cheap says one of two things:

  1. I am cheap because I'm not as good as somebody who charges more
  2. I let other people dictate the value of my skills and services when they really don't know the value of what I have to offer

Rather than lower my costs to compete with Fiverr developers or to get clients who would likely really suck to work for anyways, I would rather put efforts into fundraising for Tar Heel Dev Studio so I can provide services to non-profits at a cost that fits their budget. Companies who can afford to pay what I would normally charge will still get the most value for the services that I provide and I'll bet that it still will be considered quite reasonable when compared to my competitors.

Not all of our projects will be for clients. A part of my business plan is to have an open-source community to create tools and apps that will use the SaaS business model. I have a few app ideas already that I talk about [in a seperate post](/posts/open-source-app-ideas.md) that you can take a look at. They will offer sponsorship and will have other funding platforms linked to the project page once they get kicked off, but they will provide a service as well as opportunities for other developers to be a part of our work.

Open-source software is a vital part of the development world and I want Tar Heel Dev Studio to contribute to something that I believe strongly in. Education is something that I also believe strongly in, especially when it comes to getting young people, disadvantaged individuals - well anyone actually. I have a few blogs I maintain, but haven't created stuff for in a while. You can find out more about [the content I create on this post](/posts/content-projects.md).

## Summing It All Up

So to sum it all up - your contributions make it possible for me to totally focus on creating and providing value for others so I don't have to spend my time worrying about how make money. The biggest stresser for me right now, [other than trying to get my Macbook back](/posts/urgent-help-save-andrews-macbook.md), is trying to get inside as winter approaches. It is going to be a really cold winter and we really are not prepared as we all our heavy sleeping bags and coats stolen recently.

For one, we really just have had enough of being homeless and have taken about every step we can to get ourselves out of this situation. There is really just no help out here at all from anywhere - we've looked into every nook and cranny when it comes to resources. What it is going to take is a big change in our income through the efforts of this business or by getting a full-time job as a developer with a decent salary. I have poured everything I have into both of these two endeavors since May and I haven't started to make any money yet - something has to give eventually.

While I would love to be able to afford changing our situation, I still will prioritize Tar Heel Dev Studio business expenses. My priorities are currently:

  1. [Get the Macbook back so I don't lose it and Lisa can start to help me out](/posts/urgent-help-save-andrews-macbook.md)
  2. [Pay for tools and software that I need for operations](/posts/tools-and-software-expenses.md)
  3. [Servers and domains for hosting projects](/posts/servers-domains-and-hosting.md)

If we raise enough money, sure we will get ourselves up and off the streets as soon as possible. But I have to make sure I get these costs covered or I won't have a business. These will be categorized and shared in our expense report and you will actually be able to verify I am paying for these things through this site and on the [Tar Heel Dev Studio/GeauxWeisbeck4 Open Collective page](https://opencollective.com/geauxweisbeck4).
