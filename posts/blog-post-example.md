## URGENT - Help me get my laptop out of pawn shop

I know what you are thinking and what people will say - why would you pawn your laptop? Save your breath though because I have already beat myself down on this one. To understand the reason why I pawned it, I have to explain the situation that I was in.

## Unhoused and Looking for Work

My fiance and I have been unhoused now for almost two years. I don't want to get too much into it because I don't want it to be how I am seen as an entrepreneur or a person and I don't expect nor want you to feel sorry for me. Empathy, kindness, and respect are all acceptable, but I don't want sympathy for my situation. It is what it is and it has been extremely challenging, but I really think being homeless has made me a better person and has motivated me to work my ass off lately.

I also want to be clear that I am not sitting here trying to beg for money. I already had to do that to survive for a few months and it really sucked. A few important choices allowed me to focus on other things and I now spend my time working on projects, building my business, applying for jobs, seeking new clients, and learning everyday to become the best developer I can be.

I also did have a job from May through August of this year at Walmart. The pay wasn't going to get us into housing and I didn't get treated very well because of my living situation. It's also worth mentioning that my job had me loading stuff into people's cars all day in extremely hot and humid working conditions. After working 8 hours during the hottest part of the day (1:30 pm - 10), I would have to attempt to sleep in our tent and it really didn't cool off at all during the night, so I usually laid awake sweating all night until the sun would come up.

While I was initially enthusiastic about having a job and purpose again after a long period of unemployment, I quickly became depressed, physically exhausted, and mentally drained from dealing with how I was treated by Walmart. All the money I made went to feeding two people and paying for a hotel room a couple nights a week to get out of the extreme heat for a bit. My fiance could tell that working at Walmart was taking a big toll on me and talked to me about quitting and focusing my developer career.

## Learning, Applying to Jobs, and Tar Heel Dev Studio

Now I have been learning programming in one form or another since graduating college in 2014. But I really started learning full-stack development in 2020 and got my first tech oriented role at a cybersecurity company in 2021. After I lost that job in 2021, I really got serious about learning and switching careers to become a full-stack developer.

2022 was difficult and I had maybe close to 30 interviews for developer jobs and it really shook my confidence. I finally had an interview in November 2022 and I impressed a company enough to want to hire me - there was a problem though. I lived in Raleigh, NC with no car and the job was all the way out in a forest somewhere near Durham, NC. I couldn't take the job and it has taken me a while to get back into interviewing for jobs due to being homeless.

Now I technically started Tar Heel Dev Studio in 2021, but I never really marketed it much even though I had a website and everything. I did most of my freelance work as just good ol' me and not as the Tar Heel Dev Studio brand. I've always had the brand in the back of my mind and never gave up on the brand. That brings us to the last few months.

About a month ago, I had been in a cycle of just non-stop studying for coding interviews and applying for jobs. I wasn't building any projects that would make me money, mainly just projects that helped me grow my skills as a developer. I credit the lack of bills, low cost of living, and the amount of free time I've had to really taking a huge leap forward as a developer. I feel on top of my game right now and it honestly has been awesome to get to learn all day every day.

But as somebody who studied for a master's in economics that that I never have been able to complete, I understand that there is an opportunity cost for every decision that I make. The opportunity cost for learning so much was missing out on money that could have been made. My fiance has had to continue to panhandle while we both continue to look for work and neither of us like that she still has to do that. I am still applying for jobs and waiting on that process takes time, so I decided that something had to be done.

That b

So yes, I am still currently trying to figure out my living situation and that would be my priority besides one crucial fact - my laptop pawn shop payment is due today and if I don't pay it, they might take it to sell it. Now I am going to try and extend
