## Donate to Tar Heel Dev Studio

Starting a business is really difficult, especially when you have virtually no budget and it is your entire source of income. As of now, I am a one man start up with a really tight budget - like very tight. Any contribution would help out in a significant way while I am searching for employment to help finance my company.

When you make a donation to Tar Heel Dev Studio, it allows me to afford expenses that I other wise could not afford. I can pay for tools and software needed for building my open source projects and ideas. Donations also give me the privilege to help non-profits and small businesses at a very affordable rate in comparison to industry standards - I would like to even do projects for ceartain non-profits for free when possible.

## Ways to Donate

I try to include all the payment platforms that I can think of to make it as easy as possible for your donations. Right now I am set up as a Sole-Proprietor so there are no constraints on how payments are made yet - I intend to register a non-profit and an LLC when I can afford to. Until then, choose whatever is easiest for you!
